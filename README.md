# My custom xbps repository for patched suckless tools

This is my self-made xbps repo of my builds of some suckless tools ([suckless.org](https://suckelss.org)).

The main purpose was to have an ability to install custom `dmenu` replacing standard repo version.

Included in the repo are:
- `dwm`, ver. 6.2
- `st`, ver. 0.8.4
- `dmenu`, ver. 5.0

You should have `Fira Code` and `FiraCode Nerd Font` already installed on your system.
