# My custom xbps repository

This is my self-made xbps repo of my builds of some suckless tools ([suckless.org](https://suckelss.org)) and some other cool stuff tweaked for my own needs.

The main purpose was to have an ability to install custom `dmenu` replacing standard repo version.

Included in the repo are:
- `dwm`, ver. 6.2
- `st`, ver. 0.8.4
- `dmenu`, ver. 5.0
- `xdgmenumaker`, ver. 1.6, by @gapan
    - I've allowed IceWM to use svg icons as the version in the standard repo allows it
- `bspswallow`, by @JopStro
    - Just packaged for the ease of installation

You should have `Fira Code` and `FiraCode Nerd Font` already installed on your system to use my suckless tools builds.
